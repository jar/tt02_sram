  title:        "8x8 SRAM"
  description:  "Write to and Read from 8 addressable 8-bit words of memory"
  how_it_works: "Write Enable (WEn) pin high while passing 4-bits low data, 4-bits high data, and a 3-bit address. While WEn low, 3-bit address returns 8-bit output. The highest 4th bit of the address is ignored."
  how_to_test:  "After reset, you can write values into memory and read"
