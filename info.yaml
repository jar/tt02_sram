  title:        "8x8 SRAM"
  description:  "Write to and Read from 8 addressable 8-bit words of memory"
  how_it_works: "Write Enable (WE) pin high while passing 4-bits low data, 4-bits high data into an 8-bit temporary shift register. Then Commit high while passing a 3-bit address places the register value into memory. While Output Enable (OE) high, a 3-bit address places the data from memory into the temporary register returns 8-bit register to output data interface.  The highest 4th bit of the address is ignored. Fast memset, such as zeroing memory, can be performed with Commit high while passing a new address per clock cycle."
  how_to_test:  "After reset, you can write values into memory and read back. See the verilator testbench."
